# CampusPriceAndDice
An application that allows users to determine which restaurant on campus they eat at by comparing prices and menu items.
# Description
Campus Price and Dice is designed to help students find food priced at their preference. The application will preload
data from campus restaurants, where each restaurant contains a list of food items, each tied to a price. This data can be
displayed differently given the student's input, e.g. a student will want to find the cheapest item at McDonalds.

Restaurants/food items can be added/deleted/updated. A student can search for a particular restaurant. The manner in which the data is displayed can be manipulated, i.e. food items/restaurants can be listed alphabetically, and food items by price. Additionally, a student can find the most expensive/least expensive food item (from any given restaurant), and the average price of food at a restaurant.
